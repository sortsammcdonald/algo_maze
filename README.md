- So I think I have the right elements in the maze class, I just need to work out how to call the input function and have it progressively update.

- I think I can use composition to pass the location attribute from the MazeMoment class to the Maze class

- Need to work out how to print something with Plane.
- Could I make a more generic object to represent a plane, of which a maze is a form that has a maze layout.
- Review DK's code, try to make adjustments
- Remove specific numbers for rows and columns, let the users define that when calling the function.

- Could I generate the grid and then hide it?
- Should a grid be a class on it's own? (I could specify some parameter when I call it at main then)

- Can you beat the algorithm? Users try to navigate through the maze faster the algorithms.
- I need to figure out a way to get a cursor to represent the play and express movement.
