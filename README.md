This programme is based on an exercise from *Classic Computer Science Problems in Python* by David Kopec. You can read his code [here](https://github.com/davecom/ClassicComputerScienceProblemsInPython/tree/master/hapter2).

My programme creates a maze in your terminal that is composed of standard letter characters. You can navigate the maze by typing compass directions into the terminal. You should try to go from the start to the goal. 

However, you are not the only one attempting to traverse this maze. Following Kopec's original programme, several algorithms are also working through it - specifically breadth first Search, depth first search, and A*. 

This programme will track the number of moves you take to complete the maze as well as the algorithms. See if you can beat them!
